instruction	"Welcome to our card game. Your winnings will earn you additional payment bonus for the study. If no money will be earned in the card game, you will still get  2.5 for completing the study.  However, you can gain up to  5 overall based on winnings in the game. 
<br>We will now provide instructions regarding the card game. Please read them carefully. You can freely go back and forth between the instructions screens. In the end of the instructions we will ask you to complete a short test, to make sure everything is well understood.

instruction	"Below is an example of a card-deck with four cards, very much like the cards in the game to follow. "	0	2		
instruction	"On each step, only two cards from the deck will be offered (as shown in the example below). 
<br>You will be able to select a card using a RIGHT ('K') or LEFT ('S') key-press. 
<br>Please do your best to respond as fast and accurate as you can."	0	3		
instruction	"After selecting the card, you will see an outcome in the middle of the screen, as shown below. The outcome very much depends on the card you chose. Some cards in the deck are better than others. Your job is to find out which card is the best in the deck at any time and choose it. Two important things to remember:<br><br>1. How good a card is can change along the game, somewhat similar to the value of market products that sometimes worth more and sometimes less. <br>2. Only the cards predict an outcome. The response key that was used to select a card does not influence the chances of winning. "	0	4		
instruction	"Finally, the game includes two types of card decks. 
<br>'Good' decks, indicated by a green frame can only lead to an additional game-coin, or no coin. 




<br><Br>
'Bad' decks, indicated by a red frame, can only lead to a loss of a game-coin or no-coin. 




<br><br>
Your job is to find out which is the best card in the deck and choose it in order to gain as much game-coins or, alternatively, to lose as little game-coins ,as possible - depending on the type of deck (green or red). How much you win or lose is very much up to you! "	0	5		
instruction	"At the start of the card game, we will first provide you with 100 game-coins. In the end of the experiment, these will be exchanged to a bonus of up to  2.5. You will only be able to see your overall winnings in the end of the experiment. 
<br><br>On every step, try to be focused and find the card that is more likely to earn you a coin or, alternatively, less likely to take a coin from you.
